Best Practices for Full-Stack Development

General Coding Principles
1.Modular Design: Build reusable, composable components to enhance maintainability.
2.Type Annotations: Use type annotations for all function signatures, model fields, and variables to enable robust type checking.
3.Consistent Naming:
•Python: Use lower_case_with_underscores for variables, functions, and filenames.
•TypeScript: Use kebab-case for directories and camelCase for variables and functions.
4.Avoid Magic Numbers: Replace hardcoded values with descriptive named constants.
5.Edge Cases: Always handle edge cases in logic to prevent unexpected behavior.
6.Assertions: Use assertions to validate assumptions and catch errors early.
7.Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests for all models, utility functions, and components.

Python (Backend with FastAPI)

Code Structure
•Directories:
•src/: Application source code.
•tests/: Unit tests and integration tests.
•document_processor/: Document processing utilities.
•Files:
•routers/: API route definitions (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
•models/: Database models and schemas.
•utils/: Helper functions and reusable logic.

Key Practices
1.Type Hints: Use type hints for all functions (def for sync, async def for async).
2.Validation: Use Pydantic models for input validation. Leverage:
•@field_validator for field-level validation.
•@computed_field for derived properties.
•ConfigDict for model configuration.
3.Error Handling:
•Use custom exceptions for clarity.
•Implement guard clauses to avoid deeply nested logic.
•Log errors using logging for traceability.
4.RORO Pattern: Follow the “Receive an Object, Return an Object” principle for clean API interfaces.
5.Mutable Defaults: Use default_factory for mutable fields in Pydantic models.

TypeScript (Frontend with React)

Code Structure
•   Directories:
•   src/: Main source code.
•   components/: Reusable UI components (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
•   hooks/: Custom React hooks.
•   contexts/: Context API implementations.
•   pages/: Page-level components.
•   Configuration Files:
•   vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js.

Key Practices
1.Functional Components: Use React functional components and hooks for state management.
2.Descriptive Names: Use meaningful names like isLoading, hasError, onSubmit.
3.Error Boundaries: Implement error boundaries for React components where necessary.
4.Styling: Use Tailwind CSS with utility-first principles and Shadcn UI for accessible, customizable design systems.
5.State Management: Prefer the Context API or lightweight state management libraries (e.g., Zustand) over complex solutions unless necessary.

DevOps and Environment Configuration

Environment Variables
•Use .env files for secrets and configuration. Provide .env.example for default settings.

Docker Setup
•Use separate Dockerfile and Dockerfile.dev files for production and development environments.

Database
•Use PostgreSQL for production with migrations managed by Alembic.
•Use SQLite for lightweight local development.

Advanced Practices

Testing
•Use pytest for backend unit tests and Jest for frontend testing.
•Ensure 100% coverage for critical models, functions, and components.

Documentation
•Use description in Pydantic models’ Field() to document fields.
•Generate API documentation automatically with FastAPI’s built-in tools.

Error Handling
•Centralize error-handling logic for both backend and frontend.
•Provide user-friendly messages on the frontend and detailed logs on the backend.

Optimization
•Use lazy loading and code splitting in React for faster load times.
•Optimize database queries and API responses using profiling tools.
