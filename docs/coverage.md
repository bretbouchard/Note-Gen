# Code Coverage Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an analysis of the current code coverage in the project. It aims to identify areas with the least support and outline actionable steps for improvement.

## Current State of Coverage

- **Total Tests Run**: 47
- **Total Lines Covered**: 962
- **Total Lines in Codebase**: 1928
- **Coverage Percentage**: 50%

## Areas with Least Support

### 1. **Files with Low Coverage**

- **File: `src/models/chord_progression_generator.py`**
  - **Coverage**: 48%
  - **Lines Not Covered**: 96
  - **Details**: This file is responsible for generating chord progressions based on user input. It currently lacks sufficient tests, which is critical for ensuring its functionality.

- **File: `src/models/note.py`**
  - **Coverage**: 56%
  - **Lines Not Covered**: 67
  - **Details**: This file contains the data structures and methods for musical notes, which are essential for the application.

- **File: `src/models/scale_info.py`**
  - **Coverage**: 38%
  - **Lines Not Covered**: 61
  - **Details**: This file handles scale information and validation, and it needs additional tests to ensure data integrity.

### 2. **Specific Areas of Concern**


- **Functionality: Validation Methods**
  - **Files**: [List files with validation methods that are not covered]
  - **Details**: Validation is critical for ensuring data integrity, and lack of tests here can lead to runtime errors.

## Actionable Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Increase Coverage in Critical Areas**:
   - Focus on files and methods listed under "Areas with Low Coverage".
   - Write unit tests for any uncovered methods, especially those related to core functionality.

2. **Review and Refactor**:
   - Review the methods that are complex or have many branches.
   - Refactor if necessary to simplify the logic and make it easier to test.

### Longer-Term Goals

1. **Establish Coverage Goals**:
   - Set a target coverage percentage for the project (e.g., 80%).
   - Regularly review coverage reports to track progress.

2. **Automate Testing**:
   - Integrate coverage checks into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure new code meets coverage standards before merging.

3. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Provide documentation on how to write tests and the importance of coverage.
   - Consider training sessions for the team to improve testing practices.
