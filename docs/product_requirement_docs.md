# Note-Gen Product Requirements

## Project Overview
Note-Gen is a music generation system that creates musical patterns and progressions based on music theory rules and user preferences.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Pattern Generation
- Generate musically valid note patterns
- Support different musical scales and modes
- Handle rhythm patterns with various time signatures
- Ensure patterns follow music theory rules

### 2. Chord Progression Generation
- Create valid chord progressions in given keys
- Support major and minor scales
- Allow for different progression complexities
- Maintain voice leading rules

### 3. Validation System
- Validate all musical inputs against theory rules
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Ensure type safety with Pydantic v2
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 4. API Interface
- Provide RESTful endpoints for all operations
- Support versioning for API stability
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Implement proper rate limiting

## Quality Requirements

### 1. Testing
