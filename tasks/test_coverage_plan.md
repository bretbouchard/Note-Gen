### Implementation Strategy
1. Write test cases first (TDD approach)
2. Focus on core functionality
3. Add edge cases
4. Document test coverage improvements
5. Integrate with validation framework
6. Verify with automated testing pipeline

### Recent Progress
- Completed scale_info.py coverage (100%)
- Implemented enhanced validation framework
- Added comprehensive edge cases for scale types
- Integrated with new validation manager
- Added automated test reporting
