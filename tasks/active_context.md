# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
Improving test coverage and validation in core components.

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Current Sprint Focus
- [ ] chord_progression_generator.py (50% â†’ 80%)
  - [ ] Basic progression creation tests
  - [ ] generate_from_roman_numerals method testing
  - [ ] Pattern-based generation tests
  - [ ] Scale compatibility validation

- [ ] ScaleDegree Integration Phase 1
  - [x] Update Scale model to use ScaleDegree consistently
  - [x] Enhance ScaleInfo degree operations
  - [x] Add roman numeral conversion utilities
  - [x] Implement chord quality mapping
  - [ ] Add comprehensive validation tests

- [ ] NotePattern Validation Phase 2
  - [x] Interval validation against scale types
  - [x] Basic dissonance checks
  - [x] Interval spacing rules
  - [x] Voice leading validation
  - [ ] Advanced pattern compatibility checks
  - [ ] Complex rhythm pattern validation

- [ ] Database Layer Improvements
  - [x] Implement MongoDB repository pattern
  - [x] Add connection pooling
  - [x] Standardize connection management
  - [x] Add database migrations system
  - [ ] Complete transaction support testing

### 2. Tracking
- [x] Create daily test coverage reports
- [x] Document discovered issues
- [x] Update coverage metrics weekly
- [ ] Implement automated validation reporting

## Recent Changes
